#	What is MentalSelf?

#### MentalSelf is a free service for testing you or your child's likelihood of having a mental disorder. The tests provided use the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition or DSM-5.

#### The DSM-5 is the authoritative volume of defining and classifying mentals disorders, produced by hundreds of international experts working over 10 years in every aspect of mental health. 

#### By making the tests produced by the DSM-5 more accessible, MentalSelf hopes to both help those in need of mental health recovery and management services as well as end the stigma around seeking those services.
