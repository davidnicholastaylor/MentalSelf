        <h4>
            MentalSelf is a free service for testing you or your child's likelihood of having a mental disorder. The tests provided use the criteria of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition</a> or DSM-5. 
            <br />
            <br />
            The DSM-5 is the authoritative volume of defining and classifying mentals disorders, produced by hundreds of international experts working over 10 years in every aspect of mental health. 
            <br />
            <br />
            By making the tests produced by the DSM-5 more accessible, MentalSelf hopes to both help those in need of mental health recovery and management services as well as end the stigma around seeking those services. 
            <br />
